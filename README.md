# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Guitar
Gesture Controlled Virtual Guitar uses computer vision and hand-tracking to let users play guitar through natural gestures like strumming and chord changes. It combines real-time gesture recognition with audio synthesis, making music more interactive, fun, and accessible without a physical instrument.
